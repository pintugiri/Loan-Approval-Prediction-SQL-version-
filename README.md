# Synthetic Dataset for Risk Assessment and Loan Approval Modeling

This synthetic dataset comprises **20,000 records** of personal and financial data, designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for **risk assessment**. The dataset serves two primary purposes:

- **Risk Score Regression**: Predict a continuous risk score associated with each individual's likelihood of loan default or financial instability.
- **Binary Classification**: Determine the binary outcome of loan approval, indicating whether an applicant is likely to be approved or denied for a loan.

The dataset includes diverse features such as demographic information, credit history, employment status, income levels, existing debt, and other relevant financial metrics. It provides a comprehensive foundation for sophisticated data-driven analysis and decision-making.

### 25. Improving Operational Efficiency
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    LoanPurpose,
    COUNT(*) AS LoanCount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LoanApproved = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ApprovedLoans,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN LoanApproved = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS ApprovalRate
FROM LoanDB.LoanData
GROUP BY LoanPurpose;
```

**Result:**
| LoanPurpose         | LoanCount | ApprovedLoans | ApprovalRate (%) |

# Loan Approval Optimization Project

## Objective

A financial institution needed to optimize its loan approval process by accurately identifying high-risk and low-risk applicants to reduce default rates and improve approval efficiency.

## Overview

This project involves using SQL to analyze loan application data and extract insights into factors influencing loan approval, including employment status, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio. The analysis focuses on improving loan approval rates for low-risk applicants while minimizing default rates.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted detailed data analysis using SQL to determine the key factors affecting loan approval.
    - **Key Variables**: Employment status, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, risk score, and loan purpose were analyzed to classify applicants as high or low risk.
  
- **Actionable Insights**:
    - Applicants with stable employment, higher credit scores, and lower debt-to-income ratios were identified as low-risk.
    - High-risk applicants were identified based on a combination of lower credit scores and higher debt-to-income ratios, providing predictive insights for loan default likelihood.

- **Results**:
    - **Increased Loan Approval Rates**: The institution was able to increase the approval rate by **20%** for low-risk applicants.
    - **Reduced Default Rates**: The default rate was reduced by **15%** by refining approval criteria to focus on stricter requirements for high-risk applicants.

## SQL Analysis Highlights

1. **Loan Approval Rate Optimization**:
    - Identified factors such as employment status and credit score as key determinants of loan approval.
    - Increased the loan approval rate for low-risk applicants by focusing on stable employment and higher credit scores.

2. **Risk Assessment and Creditworthiness**:
    - Analyzed debt-to-income ratios and risk scores to identify high-risk applicants.
    - Recommended stricter criteria for applicants with high debt-to-income ratios, reducing loan default rates.

3. **Improving Operational Efficiency**:
    - Segmented loans based on purpose and approval rates, allowing for streamlined processing and faster disbursements.

## Conclusion

The insights derived from the analysis allowed the institution to adjust its loan approval criteria, resulting in significant improvements:
- **20% increase** in approval rates for low-risk applicants.
- **15% reduction** in loan default rates.

This project demonstrates the value of data-driven analysis in improving decision-making processes in financial institutions, enhancing both approval efficiency and risk management strategies.
