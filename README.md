# Synthetic Dataset for Risk Assessment and Loan Approval Modeling

This synthetic dataset comprises **20,000 records** of personal and financial data, designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for **risk assessment**. The dataset serves two primary purposes:

- **Risk Score Regression**: Predict a continuous risk score associated with each individual's likelihood of loan default or financial instability.
- **Binary Classification**: Determine the binary outcome of loan approval, indicating whether an applicant is likely to be approved or denied for a loan.

The dataset includes diverse features such as demographic information, credit history, employment status, income levels, existing debt, and other relevant financial metrics. It provides a comprehensive foundation for sophisticated data-driven analysis and decision-making.
